# what I was trying to do
I tried to read and understand the readings and made an attempt at the ADS task.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
This general sentiment of communication and it's importance in the presentation of data doesn't connect directly with anything specific but does remind me of the ideas of cherry-picking data and how poor communication of data can lead people that are looking for data that supports a faulty or harmful view to further twist poorly communicated data to further their own goals.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Approached the ADS task
	+ was intrigued by the code and the data but despite the notes was still unclear on where to go. My own fault for not asking for help since I didn't give myself enough time to do that.

## challenges 
The issue i m,entioned regarding the ADS task really. Which is all me and I am genuinely trying to get on top of.
## thoughts on where to go next
I'm not sure about how week 10 is going to go but I already got a lot of ideas for week 11  so looking forward to that one.
